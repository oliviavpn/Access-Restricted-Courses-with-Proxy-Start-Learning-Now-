## What is a Proxy?

You might have heard about proxies but wondered what they really do. In simple terms, a proxy acts like a middleman between your device and the internet. Instead of connecting directly to a website, your request goes through the proxy server, which then fetches the data for you.

This way:
- Your **real IP address is hidden**
- You **appear to be browsing from the proxy’s location**

This is especially useful if you want to **bypass geo-restrictions** or **access content that’s blocked in your region**.

## Benefits of Online Courses

Online courses have changed the way we learn, offering:
- Flexibility and convenience  
- A vast range of topics  
- Self-paced learning  
- Live webinars, quizzes, and community forums  

But here’s the catch:  
Some courses are **locked behind regional restrictions** or **special access rules**.

## How Can Residential Proxies Help You Access Restricted Online Courses?

This is where **residential proxies** shine.

Unlike datacenter proxies (which often get flagged), residential proxies:
- Use **real IPs from actual devices**
- Let you **appear as a genuine local user** from any chosen country

For example:  
If a course is only available in the US, UK, or another region, you can use a residential proxy from that region to **access the course with no restrictions**.

It’s like having a **virtual passport**—you can enroll, watch, and participate as if you were physically there.

## What Online Learning Platforms Need a Proxy for Unlocking?

Several major platforms apply regional content filters or restrict certain features:

- **Coursera** – Region-locked university courses  
- **Udemy** – Different catalogs per country  
- **LinkedIn Learning** – Enterprise content access varies  
- **edX** – Some courses are country-exclusive  
- **Skillshare** – Regional pricing and content access  

Ever seen “This content isn’t available in your country”?  
A proxy can bypass that **in seconds**.

## How to Choose a Proxy for Accessing Restricted Online Courses

When selecting a proxy service, consider:

- ✅ **Residential IPs** – Mimic real users, less likely to be blocked  
- 🔁 **Rotating IPs** – Regularly changing IP avoids detection  
- ⚡ **Fast speeds** – Crucial for streaming video lessons and webinars  
- 🌍 **Wide geo-coverage** – Access courses available globally  
- 🛠️ **Reliable support** – Helpful if you hit access or setup issues
